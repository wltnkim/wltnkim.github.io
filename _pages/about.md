I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/), Lincoln, NE, USA. I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computer Engineering from [Keimyung University](https://www.kmu.ac.kr/uni/main/main.jsp), Daegu, South Korea. My research focuses on developing robust computer vision and machine learning models for understanding human behavior in complex, real-world environments. I specialize in leveraging multimodal data and sequence modeling to address challenges in automotive and human-computer interaction domains.

For more, please look up my [Curriculum Vitae](http://wltnkim.github.io/files/JisuKim_CV_20262022.pdf).

## RESEARCH INTERESTS
